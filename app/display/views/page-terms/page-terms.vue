    1. Acceptance of Terms
    By accessing or using Calystone (“the App”), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service (“Terms”). If you do not agree, you may not use Calystone. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access Calystone.

    2. Description of Calystone
    Calystone is an open-source, self-management application that integrates with:

    Local file systems via the File System Access API
    Third-party file services (Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox, etc.)
    Calystone does not have its own backend or database and does not store any personal user data or files on any servers controlled by Calystone.

    3. Third-Party Services
    Integration with File Services:
    Calystone may request permissions to read, edit, and save your files when you opt to connect it with third-party cloud services. Use of these third-party services is governed by each provider’s terms and policies (e.g., Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox).
    No Control Over Third Parties:
    Calystone is not responsible for any actions or omissions by third-party services. Your use of third-party services is at your own risk.
    4. User Responsibilities
    Access and Permissions:
    You are responsible for granting the permissions required by Calystone to access files on your local system or cloud storage. You may revoke these permissions at any time using the relevant settings in your browser or third-party service.

    You are fully responsible for maintaining and backing up your own files. Calystone does not store or back up any of your files on its own servers.

    You agree to use Calystone in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations in your jurisdiction.
    5. Data Ownership and Privacy
